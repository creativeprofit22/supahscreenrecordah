description: Run checks, commit with AI message, and push
---

1. Run quality checks:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run test`
   Fix ALL errors before continuing.

2. Review changes: run `git status`, `git diff --staged`, and `git diff`

3. Stage relevant files with `git add` (specific files, not -A)

4. Generate a commit message:
   - Start with a verb (Add/Update/Fix/Remove/Refactor)
   - Be specific and concise, one line preferred

5. Commit and push:
   `git commit -m "your generated message"` then `git push`
